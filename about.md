My name is Ryan Morr, I am a web developer residing in Barrie, Ontario, Canada with a real passion for everything related to front-end web development.

I am a JavaScript fanatic, strong advocate for the open web, and although I wouldn't characterize myself as a designer, I do love to dabble in UI and UX design because nothing beats a well designed interface. 

I am a proud Canadian, as such, hockey is my religion. I'm also a huge movie buff, astronomy aficionado, fitness enthusiast, and an intense fantasy sports competitor.

This blog is dedicated to my adventures in front-end web development. I will be discussing different concepts, opinions, and ideas as well as sharing various open source projects.
