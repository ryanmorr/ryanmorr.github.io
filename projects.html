<p>All projects are hosted on <a href="http://github.com/ryanmorr">GitHub</a>. There you can star them, watch them, and fork them (contributions are welcome). All of my code is dedicated to the public domain as described by the <a href="http://unlicense.org/">Unlicense</a>. That's just a fancy way of saying you can use my code anyway you like.</p>

{% for repository in site.github.public_repositories %}
    <section class="project">
        <h3 class="project-title"><a href="{{ repository.html_url }}">{{ repository.name }}</a></h3>
        <p class="project-description">{{ repository.description }}</p>
    </section>
{% endfor %}
